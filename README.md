# Flowslicer

Flowslicer extracts data flow slices from binaries.  It can then ingest them into a database, then compare them with
match set analysis.

See the related project [REveal](https://github.com/praxiseng/reveal)

## Prerequisites

Flowslicer requires Python 3.10 or newer.

A Binary Ninja license with "GUI-less processing" is needed to run the command line.  There are plans to make it
available purely through the plug-in interface to allow Binary Ninja users with personal licences to use this tool,
but that is not yet implemented.

To install the Binary Ninja API, run `scripts/install_api.py` with your specific python interpreter.

Also install the `cbor2` library using pip:

```commandline
python -m pip install cbor2
```


# Command line reference

```commandline
usage: flowslicer.py [-h] [--db [PATH]] [--slices [PATH]] [--function NAME [NAME ...]] [--force-update] [--parallelism N] [-v] {search,ingest,slice} [files ...]

Data flow slicing and match set analysis tool.

positional arguments:
  {search,ingest,slice}
                        Command to run
  files                 List of binaries to slice, slice files to ingest, or slice files to search. Folders will be recursively enumerated.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --db [PATH]           Database file for ingest and search. Defaults to "slices.slicedb".
  -v, --verbose

Slice command options:
  --slices [PATH]       Folder to place slice files and logs. Defaults to "data_flow_slices".
  --function NAME [NAME ...]
  --force-update
  --parallelism N
```

## The `slice` command

The slice command will take a list of binaries (or folders to enumerate binaries) and produce a `.slices` file for each 
binary.  These `.slices` files will be placed in a folder specified by `--slices` (defaults to `data_flow_slices`).

These `.slices` files can then be processed and combined into a single database file using `ingest` command or used
for search files using the `search` command.

Example usage:

```commandline
./flowslicer.py slice sample_binaries/linux_bin/ --slices slices/linux_bin --parallelism 10
``` 

This command will process all executables in the sample_binaries\linux_bin folder, create a folder called
`slices/linux_bin/`, and generate one `.slices` file for each binary in that folder.  900 linux binaries takes up to 90 
minutes.

### Notes on Parallelism

The data flow slicing process can take a long time, depending on the binaries. For example, on an Intel 12700H 
processor (14C 20T) `--parallelism 10` will spin up 10 instances to load the cores to nearly 100%, and can process 
900 linux files from `/usr/bin` in about 90 minutes.

Note that while each parallel instance will create a separate Binary Ninja (headless) instance, and each Binary Ninja
instance is multi-threaded.  However, some of the processing will be single-threaded in the python script, so a 
parallelism limit somewhere in the 50-75% of the physical cores is recommended to saturate processing resources.

The memory usage per instance can vary greatly per binary.  With basic Linux and Windows system binaries and Binary
Ninja 3.3, each binary probably uses an average of 1GB, with few binaries exceeding 2GB of memory.  So a 
parallelism-to-memory ratio of 1:2GB should be sufficient for processing the majority of binaries.

However, some binaries can consume much more memory.  For example, according to the Binary Ninja blog Linux Chrome 
with full symbols can consume ~34GB of memory.  Since Flowslicer will output to a `.temp` file and rename to `.slices`
only after processing completes, binaries that failed with out-of-memory can be retried with more memory (e.g. lower
parallelism to increase memory ratio).

## The `ingest` command

The `ingest` command takes a list of files with the `.slices` extension and combines them into a single `.slicedb` file. 

>  ./flowslicer.py ingest --db linux_bin.slicedb slices/linux_bin

Example output:
```commandline
...
   691 slices,    428 unique slices\linux_bin\zdump.slices
  6929 slices,   2842 unique slices\linux_bin\zenity.slices
  9246 slices,   4309 unique slices\linux_bin\zipinfo.slices
  2095 slices,   1062 unique slices\linux_bin\[.slices
Merged counts 3309730
Wrote 2003995 items from 900 files to .\linux_bin.slicedb
```

## The `search` command

The `search` command searches for data flow slices
```commandline
./flowslicer.py search --db linux_bin.slicedb slices/linux_bin/git.slices
```

This produces match set output:

```commandline
...
    49 47ca9d8276ce   3 emacs-gtk git-shell git
    49 3931ec1054bc   2 git snap
    55 bcab5267e51a   5 cmake cpack ctest git-shell git
    87 9f7c6da1158a   4 git-shell git qemu-system-i386 qemu-system-x86_64
   130 e33e41aaaf48   4 git-shell git vim.basic vim.tiny
   133 91a13c5c60a9   2 gdb git
   181 e3d779ca2571   3 gdb git-shell git
   229 b398592e85f6   3 bat git-shell git
 18357 3918f20021dc   2 git-shell git
 38031 e165421110ba   1 git
```

The first column is the number of slices in the match set.  The second column is a hash of the set of files in this 
match set.  This match set hash can be used to reference the slices in the folder output by the `--detail OUT_DIR` 
option (which defaults to `match_set_detail/`).  The third column is the number of files, and the last is the list
of files by name.  Using this output, we can for example conclude there are `18357` slices that match `git-shell` and 
`git`, but no other files in the input database.

### Match Set Detail Files

When running a search command with `--detail OUT_DIR` (which defaults to `match_set_detail/`), a text file is generated
for each match set listing detailed information on all the slices that have that match set.  For example:

```commandline
Match set 3918f20021dc has 2 files
  git-shell
  git

Slices with the match set:
Slice 0001810b8c75 2 2 2      sub_1879c0           1879c9,1879fc
Slice 00022eea4ee9 2 2 2      sub_14f8c0           14f8de,14f91f,14fa6d,14fa8a,14fa9e
Slice 0002338e0e1a 2 2 2      sub_1b20a0           1b20d2,1b20d7,1b20de,1b20e9
Slice 0003bb5e377e 2 2 2      sub_1c0840           1c09d4,1c0a87,1c0a9e,1c0aac,1c0ac0,1c0e83,1c0f59,1c0fa7
...
```

This contains the following details:
* Slice hash
* Counts of the slice in other files (# files, # functions, # instances)
* From the search file, the function names and instruction addresses.

Further down the detail file, each slice is repeated but with the canonicalized text of the slice.


# Python Command Reference

Python commands can be used in either a generic Python shell (headless mode) or from within the Binary Ninja Python
console.  The Binary Ninja plugin interface has 3 configuration paths that set output directories for the `.slices`
files, the `.slicedb` file, and the detailed slice output `.txt` file.

Note: the current defaults for the 3 paths has only been tested on Windows and uses the `${USERPROFILE}` environment
variable.  These defaults may need to be manually overridden on other platforms. 

## Slicing

```commandline
import flowslicer
flowslicer.slice(r'S:\binaries\linux_bin', parallelism=10)
```
The slice command will walk the list of files/folders passed to the first parameter and slice them.  This will produce
one `.slices` file in `flowslicer.slicesDir`.  This will add/accumulate files each time it is run.

For `parallelism` greater than 1, the script must be running in headless mode and not inside Binary Ninja's Python
console.

## Ingest

```commandline
import flowslicer
flowslicer.ingest()
```

The ingest command will take all `.slices` files found in the path specified by `flowslicer.slicesDir` and produce a
single file in the path specified by `flowslicer.sliceDBPath`.

## Search

```commandline
import flowslicer
flowslicer.search(r'S:\binaries\linux_bin\ls')
```

Whether you give a path to a binary, a path to a `.slices` file, or a `BinaryView` object, (e.g. `current_view` when
running on the console), a `.slices` file will be generated if needed to use for the search.  Then it will query
the database at `flowslicer.sliceDBPath`, count match sets, and sort by number of slices in that match set.

The search command will also produce match details files at `flowslicer.detailDir`.



## Next Features

* Support not-of-interest databases that subtract out match sets that include known/common libraries.
